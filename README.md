# LOvers-que
This is a bash script that's developed to enable and make possible the communication and relationship between total strangers who are in search of lovers, partners or just random friendship that might lead to a long life commitment. This is a program that plays matchmaker between two persons or a group of people. The aim for this script is to solve a real world problem; it's no secret that people go into wrong relationships because they probably didn't know the person's true self before or they just want to have somebody because no matter how hard they try, they just can't seem to find the right person. This program is built on christianity; straight people only. No gays nor bys or anything of the like.
